# DreamJumper

DreamJumper is a little 3D Puzzle Adventure game I made for my Computer Games Development module for my MSc Computer Games Systems at NTU.  
It's a little game (around 8 minutes to complete if you fully know what to do) where the player enters inside NPC's dreams and tries to calm their nightmares.  
Those Nightmares are the puzzles of the game.

## Prerequisites
First things first you need to download the game, you can either by downloading from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Xi4yjpNAdkpLZ6Y4GuO7SAfambqgZ9C4) (Just click Dream Jumper), or my repository inside the folder Game Executable.  

```
git clone https://github.com/DarioHermann/DreamJumper
```

You'll need all three files, DreamJumper_Data Folder, DreamJumper.exe, UnityPlayer.dll and save them in a file anywhere on your PC.

## Instructions
To start it simply double click DreamJumper.exe.  
Your game should start, if it doesn't start just open an Issue.  
Unfortunately at the current version it doesn't have a quit the game option. I'm really sorry for that you'll have to simply close the running process.

## Controls
The controls are very simple.  
* WASD/Arrows - Control the character.
* Mouse - Controls the camera thereafter controlling the player's point of view.
* Space - Jump (Although it won't be of any use in this game unless you want to break it!).
* F - Interact with NPC/Object
* Q - Jump Out of a Dream (Only usable inside a Dream of course)

## Objective
The Objective of the game is to dive into every dream and complete the puzzle inside.  
In total there are three different NPC's (three different kind of dreams).  
After the player completes the three dreams, three more appear (the same puzzles but harder variants), unfortunately, the second one is incomplete (which I will change in the future), which makes the game impossible to complete e a second time.  
Be aware that everytime the player Dream Jumps (going inside a dream) it costs energy. If it's the first time jumping into a dream, it costs only one energy unit, but if the player Dream Jumps the same dream a second time, it'll cost two energy units.  
The game has a simple method of keeping the players score, the objective is to complete the game in as less in-game time as possible. Regaining energy (sleeping) will forward eight in-game hours, Dream Jumping will forward three.

## Requirements
Don't even worry about it. It will run on your nanny's PC. The only requirement you need is a Windows PC/Mac/Linux.

## Built With
* **[Unity](https://unity3d.com/)** - Game Development Environment
* **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** - 3D models (the ones done by me)

## Version
This game is on it's 1.0 version. I'll probably update it in a near future or I'll simply restart this project from scratch.
